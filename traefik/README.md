### DESCRIPTION

Configure <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.traefik.io/configuration/metrics">Traefik</a> to expose internal metrics as prometheus metrics at an endpoint. Install the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent">SignalFx Smart Agent</a> and configure it to access SignalFx and use the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/blob/9feb3f77fdf6de46dc476f62568ad4f9b725660c/docs/monitors/prometheus-exporter.md">prometheus-exporter</a> monitor.

### REQUIREMENTS AND DEPENDENCIES

| Software          | Version        |
|-------------------|----------------|
| signalfx-agent    |     3.4+       |

### INSTALLATION

Follow these steps to install this plugin:

1. Install the <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/integrations/agent/index.html">SignalFx Smart Agent</a> in your environment.
2. Modify the Smart Agent configuration file as described in [Smart Agent Configuration](#smart-agent-configuration), below.
3. Configure Traefik to expose Prometheus metrics endpoint as described in [Traefik Configuration](#traefik-configuration), below.  

### CONFIGURATION
#### Traefik Configuration
Edit the Traefik configuration file, typically `traefik.toml`, to enable Traefik to expose <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.traefik.io/configuration/metrics/">prometheus metrics</a> at endpoint. The endpoint is on path `/metrics` by default. When running the Traefik binary, the configuration file is typically passed in as a command line argument.

`./traefik -c traefik.toml`

However, when running the Traefik Docker image, the configuration file is mounted to the volume `/etc/traefik/traefik.toml`. For example,

`docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -p 80:80 -v $PWD/traefik.toml:/etc/traefik/traefik.toml`

If the configuration file is not available use the <a target="_blank" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/containous/traefik/master/traefik.sample.toml">sample configuration file</a>. The Smart Agent must have network access to Traefik. This means for instance that, in a Docker environment, the Smart Agent container needs to share a network with the Traefik container. So the Docker run command to start the agent may look as follows:
```
docker run --rm \
-e SFX_ACCESS_TOKEN=<signalfx access token> \
-e SFX_INGEST_URL=<signalfx ingest url> \
-v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
-v <agent.yaml path>:/etc/signalfx/agent.yaml \
--net <traefik container network> \
quay.io/signalfx/signalfx-agent:<version>
```
#### Smart Agent Configuration
Find and edit the Smart Agent configuration file `agent.yaml` to enable the Docker observer and configure the prometheus-exporter monitor as described <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/blob/9feb3f77fdf6de46dc476f62568ad4f9b725660c/docs/monitors/prometheus-exporter.md">here</a>. For example, the configuration below will cause the Smart Agent to query the Docker Engine API for all running containers with port 8080 exposed and export Prometheus metrics from endpoint `<container ip>:8080/metrics`.
```
observers:
  - type: docker
monitors:
  - type: prometheus-exporter
    discoveryRule: port == 8080
  extraDimensions:
    metric_source: traefik
```
Also, metrics can be excluded by configuring the `metricsToExclude` section of the Smart Agent configuration file.

### USAGE

The Smart Agent exports Prometheus metrics exposed by Traefik. These metrics can be categorized into Traefik-related, entrypoint-related and backend-related metrics. The Traefik-related metrics are prefixed by `go_` and `process_`. The entrypoint-related metrics are prefixed by `traefik_entrypoint_` and the backend-related metrics prefixed by `traefik_backend_`.

The Traefik-related metrics are for monitoring Traefik itself. For instance, the `go_memstats_sys_bytes` metric can be used to plot Traefik memory usage. The entrypoint-related and backend-related key metrics are the number and duration of requests measured at entrypoints and backends. These metrics are used to compute measurements such as the average request duration.

![EntryPoints](./img/traefik_entrypoints.png)
![Backends](./img/traefik_backends.png)

The entrypoint-related and backend-related metrics also include metrics for the number of entrypoints connections, backends connections and backend server up/down flag.
